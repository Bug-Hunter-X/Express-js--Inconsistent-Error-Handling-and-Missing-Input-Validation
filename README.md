# Express.js: Inconsistent Error Handling and Missing Input Validation

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications: inconsistent error handling and missing input validation.  The provided `bug.js` showcases code with inadequate error handling and response management.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) shows best practices for resolving this, focusing on robustness and security.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks robust error handling for database interactions and doesn't validate user input before processing.  This can lead to:

* **Unexpected crashes:** Database errors may cause the server to crash without informative error messages.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** Unvalidated input may expose the application to injection attacks.
* **Poor user experience:** The application might not provide useful feedback to the user in case of errors.

## Solution

The solution addresses these issues by:

* Implementing comprehensive error handling using try-catch blocks for database operations and input validation.
* Providing detailed error messages to the user, suitable for different HTTP error codes.
* Utilizing middleware for input validation to prevent data-related issues.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the buggy version: `node bug.js`
4. Run the solution: `node bugSolution.js`
